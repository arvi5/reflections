How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history
organized? How would branches help?
branches would be helpful when we are writing the experimental code/different piece of work. When the code works out we can merge to the master and branches helps 
you keep a project organized especially when you are sharing the project publicly.You will have the master branch and that would be the production quality branch 
that never breaks always works. We can have a development branch where active work is taking place on your project.Branches are not only good when you are collaborating publicly but also to collaborate with yourself

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

Diagrams helps us to know the project structure clearly and looking at the diagram gives us more
insights of the commits that are not visible until we make a new branch. Using diagrams helps to keep track of which branches
contains which commits.
