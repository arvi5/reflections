How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    Viewing the difference between two files makes it easy to identify the bug 

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    Without history we can not restore the previous versions which worked better

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    With automatic saving we have a history of every change which is good in some cases
but it is not good if we make small changes which have the same logical purpose.

On the other hand if we manually save need to have a right judgemental call if it is right
then the saving makes sense but if we make changes every time and commit after a lotof changes then the diffrerence will be big.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    It is because the changed file might affect the multiple files so git
changes the files which are connected but google treat every change as a seperate thingso that it can keep track of every single change for a specific file. 

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    Git log is used for getting history of the repository while git diff is used for comparing the differences between two commits

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

   With version control even if something breaks because of bug we can revert back to the previous version
   and carry on with the coding

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    git to sharemy code and commit to github
