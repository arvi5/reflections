When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When we want to share our work with others or show your work to your friends and collaborate with them.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Pulling the changes manually is the better thing because if we do the operation automatically we might not expect the changes
to the code.
