When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When we want to share our work with others or show your work to your friends and collaborate with them.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Pulling the changes manually is the better thing because if we do the operation automatically we might not expect the changes
to the code.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
fork is used with in the context of git hub,taking an existing repository and making a copy of it.
Clone works on any two repositories to make a copy on local or from remote to local
Branches is used when you want to make the changes to the existing code and add new features
